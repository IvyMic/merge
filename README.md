Pre thoughts
---------------------
I'm not fully comfortable with recursion just yet. But I am intrigued by yet
another way to sort elements in an array.

Things I'm concerned about:
1) The recursive aspect

Things I'm confident on:
1) The methodology makes sense to me, on paper at least.

Post thoughts
---------------------
The base case was easy enough to work out. Recursion is weird for me in that
the more I think about it, the more mistakes I make. Oddly enough, if I exercise
little thought and nonchalantly try to implement a recursive function it seems
to work well. This 'blind trust' (I guess you can call it) in the recursive function
feels unnatural to me, but hey it worked. I did the merge_sort2 first as it was
easier for me, then attempted a one method way of doing it.

Overall I liked this challenge but I really need to get comfortable with Recursion.
Blind trusting of recursive functions cannot work for long (surely?)

Things to improve on:
1) Understanding recursion until it feels natural to me.
